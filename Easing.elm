module Easing where

{-| Library for working with easing functions.

Easing functions interpolate a value over time.
They are mainly used to create animations (for user interfaces and games).

You can find graphical examples of easing functions on [easings.net](http://easings.net/ "Easings")

Takes as second argument list of pairs with the `Time` as first element of the pair and the fraction as second element.
